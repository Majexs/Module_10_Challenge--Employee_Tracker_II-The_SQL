## Installation
In order to run it from the command line, postres, Inquirer, & dotenv need to be installed for full functionality.
## Usage
Navigate to the relevant directory on the command line and initiate by typing 'node.js'. You'll then be presented with a series of options that allow you to modify three tables - the list of departments, roles, & employees. A demonstration video is included below in addition to some sample screenshots.

## Credits
This project was created from scratch by James Swanson, but certain functions had the assistance of various coding tutors & TAs.
## License
This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT License.
## Features
There are a couple of optional incomplete features - calculating the total budget of a department, viewing managers, viewing managers by employee. For better user experience I may add columns that include names of managers, roles, & departments rather than simply their ids. This prevents having to double check which id corresponds to which component.
